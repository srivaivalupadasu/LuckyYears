# lucky-years
Given a birthday date in the format of "dd-mm", write a function that returns all the years from the current year up to 50 years in the future where the birthday falls on a lucky day. A lucky day is defined as either a Sunday, Friday, or Saturday. 
The output should be in the format of "Day-Year" where Day is the abbreviated name of the lucky day (i.e. "Sun" for Sunday) and Year is the four-digit year. If there are multiple lucky days for a given year, separate them with a space. 
If there are no lucky days for a given year, return an empty string.
